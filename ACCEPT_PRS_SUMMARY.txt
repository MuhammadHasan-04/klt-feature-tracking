HOW TO USE
================================================================================

The changes have been committed to the copilot/accept-listed-pull-requests
branch. To complete the acceptance:

Option 1: Merge this PR to main (recommended)
  - Review the changes in PR #5
  - Approve and merge PR #5
  - This will bring all GPU acceleration changes to main

Option 2: Close original PRs as accepted
  - Comment on PRs #2, #3, #4: "Accepted and integrated in PR #5"
  - Close PRs #2, #3, #4
  - Keep PR #5 open for final review and merge

================================================================================
BUILDING WITH GPU SUPPORT
================================================================================

Requirements:
  - NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit
  - CUDA-capable GPU (compute capability 8.6+)
  - OpenCV libraries

Build commands:
  cd src/Version2
  make clean
  make lib
  make example1

For detailed instructions, see GPU_README.md

================================================================================
TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Before merging to main, consider testing:

1. Verify Makefile syntax is correct
2. Test compilation on a system with CUDA (if available)
3. Verify the original PRs #2, #3, #4 can be closed
4. Ensure no merge conflicts with main branch

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Review this PR (#5) for approval
2. Test build on a CUDA-enabled system (optional)
3. Merge PR #5 to main branch
4. Close PRs #2, #3, #4 with reference to this merge
5. Notify GulsherKhan-04 that their contributions have been accepted
