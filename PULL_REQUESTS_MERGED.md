## Merged Pull Requests

### PR #2: Makefile for GPU + CPU
**Author:** GulsherKhan-04  
**Status:** ✅ Accepted and Merged  
**Changes:**
- Updated `src/Version2/Makefile` to support both CPU and GPU compilation
- Added NVIDIA CUDA compiler (`nvcc`) support
- Added CUDA-specific compilation flags (`CUDA_FLAGS = -O2 -arch=sm_86`)
- Updated library paths to include CUDA libraries (`-L/usr/local/cuda/lib64`)
- Modified build targets to link CUDA runtime (`-lcudart`)
- Changed profiling targets to use `nvprof` instead of `gprof` for GPU profiling
- Added compilation rules for CUDA object files:
  - `convolve_cuda.o`
  - `selectGoodFeatures_cuda.o`

### PR #3: added selectfeatures.cu
**Author:** GulsherKhan-04  
**Status:** ✅ Accepted and Merged  
**Changes:**
- Created new file: `src/Version2/selectGoodFeatures.cu`
- Implements GPU-accelerated feature strength computation using CUDA
- Key features:
  - **CUDA Kernel:** `featureStrengthComputation` - Computes minimum eigenvalue for each pixel to determine feature trackability
  - **Wrapper Function:** `gpuComputeFeatureStrength` - Handles memory allocation, data transfer, kernel launch, and timing
  - Uses 16x16 thread blocks for optimal GPU utilization
  - Includes comprehensive error checking with `CUDA_CHECK` macro
  - Provides execution timing using CUDA events
- Total additions: 128 lines of CUDA C++ code

### PR #4: added header for linking selectgoodfeature kernel with cpu
**Author:** GulsherKhan-04  
**Status:** ✅ Accepted and Merged  
**Changes:**
- Created new file: `src/Version2/selectGoodFeatures.h`
- Provides C/C++ compatible header for GPU functions
- Declares `gpuComputeFeatureStrength()` function with detailed documentation
- Includes proper header guards and extern "C" linkage for C++ compatibility
- Total additions: 46 lines

## Technical Details

### GPU Acceleration Benefits
The merged changes enable GPU acceleration for the KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) feature tracking algorithm, specifically for the feature selection phase:

1. **Feature Strength Computation**: Parallelized computation of the minimum eigenvalue of the structure tensor for each pixel
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in timing using CUDA events to measure GPU execution time
3. **Memory Management**: Efficient GPU memory allocation and data transfer

### Build Requirements
After merging these PRs, building the project requires:
- NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (with `nvcc` compiler)
- CUDA-capable GPU with compute capability 8.6+ (based on `-arch=sm_86`)
- OpenCV libraries (for image processing)
- CUDA runtime library

### Usage
To build with GPU support:
```bash
cd src/Version2
make clean
make lib
make example1  # or any other example
```

To run with profiling:
```bash
make profile_example1  # Generates profile_example1.txt with GPU timing
```

## Integration Notes

All three pull requests work together to provide a complete GPU acceleration solution:
1. PR #2 provides the build infrastructure
2. PR #3 provides the GPU implementation
3. PR #4 provides the API interface

The changes are backward-compatible and maintain the existing CPU code paths in `selectGoodFeatures.c` alongside the new GPU implementation.

## Next Steps

Users can now:
- Build and run GPU-accelerated KLT tracking
- Profile GPU performance using `nvprof`
- Compare CPU vs GPU performance
- Extend GPU acceleration to other components (e.g., convolution operations)

**Note:** These PRs were originally submitted by GulsherKhan-04 and have been accepted and integrated to add GPU acceleration capabilities to the KLT feature tracking library.
